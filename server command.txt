To access the AWS server, use the SSH folder and there's a software named Putty. Using the credentials and ppk file, you can connect to the server. After connecting, you can interact with the server files. It's a bit complex process to understand or control, so it may seem complicated to understand properly.

The AWS server runs both the python web app and the queue manager script in a background session. The session is handled by screen command of Linux. 

There are two folders, each containing the web app and queue manager files separately.

Make sure to run the command correctly for each screen session (one for the webapp, another for the queue manager)
To list the screen sessions, type screen -ls
then to connect the the session, type:
screen -r ...
Replace ... with the screen session id from the list.

Now try to understand which command is running. To stop a running script, press ctrl+c and then run the command mentioned below based on which screen session you're in.
This command below starts the webapp:
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:4000 wsgi:app

Now for the queue manager session, it's placed under the /home/ubuntu/manager/ folder. This command runs the queue manager:
python3 /home/ubuntu/manager/queue_manager.py
